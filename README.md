# SSH Auto-Backup
## What is this program for?
This program keeps track of the folders you have selected to backup, and automatically uploads new/modified files to your server via SSH.
## Motivation
My home network download speed isn't particularly fast, and I tend to work from public wifi, so my upload speed is also not the fastest usually. To make the process more efficient, I decided to make a program that keeps track of what files have been changed, so I can only upload new files and/or modified files.
